TempMCPTools
===============
These are tools designed to make converting the mappings easier from the temporary sheet we have made

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14knNUYjYkKkGpW9VTyjtlhaCTUsPWRJ91GLOFX2d23Q/edit?usp=sharing

Put the original mcp files into original/ and enter a google docs token

If you want to use `copytolocalcache.py` make sure you have run a gradle setup with other mappings
then swap to `unofficialtest-1.16.1` to ensure the right folders exist already in the cache.
